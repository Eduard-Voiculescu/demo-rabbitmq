## Steps to take to run RabbitMQ

First things first, we need to install RabbitMQ.

`brew install rabbitmq`

Once we have installed RabbitMQ, we need to run it. There are numerous ways for which we can do this.

1. `brew services start rabbitmq` (will run in the background)
2. `/opt/homebrew/opt/rabbitmq/sbin/rabbitmq-server` (will run in the command prompt, we can see the logs)
3. Open new command line and type `rabbitmq-server` (will do the same as step 2)
